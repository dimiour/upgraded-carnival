health and damage specific to bullets:
    - make an enumeration or list of enumerations for the 
      classification of objects, possibly renaming them to entities

      class of that entity including absorption and drag
    - add health variable to player/enemy class enum

weapon changeability:
    - ponder possibilities for weapons
    - add cooldown for shooting


DONE

weapon changeability:
    - create variable (Weapon, Weapon) with boolean to indicate 
      which is in use
    - build a way to indicate which weapon is equipped

compartmentalize:
    - create a function in the game implementation for the user interactions
    - switch the assignment of variables in the beginning of the loop into functions for each
